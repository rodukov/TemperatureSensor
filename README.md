# TemperatureSensor
Schemes and software of the device for monitoring temperature and humidity
## Device assembly
Assembling the necessary device is quite easy
### Build indicator(3_C1r)
ðŸ“– Connect wires like mom-dad. Symbol `~` on the board means analog access
| Indicator(3_C1r) | Arduino UNO |
| :---: | :---: |
| - | GND |
| B | ~11 |
| G | ~10 |
| R | ~9 |

### Build temperature sensor(DHT11)
ðŸ“– Connect the temperature sensor with the same wires. It can also measure humidity
| Sensor(DHT11) | Arduino UNO |
| :---: | :---: |
| closer to - | GND |
| leg in the middle | 5V |
| closer to S | 2 |

### Build display(I2C)
ðŸ“– Here, too, a wired connection mom-dad. However, ports A4 and A5 cannot be changed even in the program code, unlike, for example, a sensor
| Display(I2C) | Arduino UNO |
| :---: | :---: |
| GND | GND |
| VCC | 5V |
| SDA | A4 |
| SCL | A5 |

## Upload the sketch to the board
### Download
To do this, clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/rodukov/TemperatureSensor/` <br>
### Import libraries
Launch your Arduino IDE. Then import all libraries from `libs/` folder (my repository)
### Upload sketch
To do this, go to the `main/` folder and run the file `main.ino`. Then press the upload button in your Arduino IDE
